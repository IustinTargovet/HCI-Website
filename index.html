								<p>Our client, noticed that many of the UCL students would like to join the program but never find the time to go to sessions that would help them with the proccess and even more so, apply to the Study abroad scheme.</p>
								<p>That's where we came into play and proposed a mobile app that eases the proccess up.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Johnny Dempsey's story</h2>
								<p style="font-weight: 100">Johnny is a first-year maths student who has heard about the Study Abroad program from his peers in the year above him. He wants to find out more about the institutions he might be able to apply to in the future, but can’t attend the events aimed at second-years. Johnny is just looking for some casual information, and can’t be bothered to do lots of research himself. One of his friends on his course tells him about the Study Abroad app, which he downloads from the iOS App Store. Johnny creates an account, and can’t fill in any details about grades but enters his department. He is then presented with a list of universities the Maths department offers, and information about the lifestyles in those cities. He is really interested in some of them, and decides he might want to apply when he is in second year. Johnny doesn’t need any of the information about visas or applying through the app, but selects some of his favourite unis so he remembers for next year. </p>

                        <article id="eddies">
								<h2 class="major">Eddie Dixon's story</h2>
								<p style="font-weight: 100">Eddie is a second-year international student that has been interested in the Study Abroad program since the start of term, and has discussed his options with his External Tutor already. He is almost ready to apply, however he still needs some information about his visa requirements, tuition fees and living costs that his tutor can’t help him with. His tutor recommends he consults the Study Abroad app - Eddie had already made an account, so logs in to check his favourited institutions and the FAQs about visas etc. Eddie is ready to apply, but is confused by the portico process, so chooses to upload his application and send it off via the app.

								<h2 class="major">Amy Wilson's story</h2>
								<p style="font-weight: 100">Amy went to the Study Abroad information session in the History department, and is interested in pursuing the program. She has brilliant grades and is not restricted in where she can apply to, but as she works so hard, she does not have time to research all of the universities that her department offers. The Study Abroad team can’t advise her on which are the best universities to take good History classes, so they suggest she downloads the Study Abroad app to get information that is tailored to her course. Amy creates an account, and enters all the details about her course, the modules she has taken and her grades. She then looks through all of the institutions and compares their living costs, classes, distance from home, and lifestyles. She also looks at where other people from her course have applied to, to get a good idea of where History students are best placed. She also uses the app to get the contact information for her external tutor, so that she can discuss her choices before she applies.  </p>
