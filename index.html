								<p>How 2-Study Abroad is a mobile application designed to help UCL students with applying to the Study Abroad Program during their third year. </p>
								
								<p>This application allows students to login using their UCL credentials to view information about the Study Abroad process, the institutions they can apply to, and allows them to upload supporting documents to apply to the program directly from the app.</p>

								<p>This website shows the iterative, user-centred process of development a prototype for this application, and includes citations to HCI and design literature we referenced along the way.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Client Requirements</h2>
								<p>We began the design process by conducting an interview with our client to establish the essential requirements of the app. Our interview was semi-structured, and we used Interaction Design - Beyond HCI to help design our open-ended questions. We recorded data by taking note separately and comparing afterwards, and drew up this list of requirements: </p>
								<p>Functional Requirements</p>
								<ul style="font-weight: 100">
									<li>Prospective students can input subjects and grades and return applicable institutions</li>
                                    <li>Information about visa requirements</li>
                                    <li>App returns universities suitable for specific student and personalised next steps</li>
                                    <li>Information about costs of different unis</li>
                                    <li>Apply directly to the program via app</li>
                                    <li>Attach required documentation through app</li>
                                    <li>See what courses other people are interested in</li>
                                    <li>List your favourite institutions</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Non-Functional Requirements</p>
								<ul style="font-weight: 100">
                                    <li>Mobile app compatible with iOS and Android</li>
                                    <li>Login using the UCL API</li>
                                    <li>App is more user-friendly than Portico application process</li>
                                </ul>

								<p>Next we gathered data from some potential users, by sending out a questionnaire via Facebook and asking students who were interested in the Study Abroad program to fill it in. We went through several iterations of questionnaire, using Interaction Design - Beyond HCI to design effective questions. The results of the questionnaire were: </p>

								<p>We wanted to gather relevant user data in several different ways, and the disadvantages of questionnaires also conducted a focus group. We used open-ended questions to faciliate a discussion between potential users, collecting data by taking notes as some of our participants did not consent to video/audio recording. Many of the comments we recieved were very consistent with the questionnaires, a summary of which can be seen below: </p>

								<h2 class="major">Johnny Dempsey's story</h2>
								<p style="font-weight: 100">Johnny is a first-year maths student who has heard about the Study Abroad program from his peers in the year above him. He wants to find out more about the institutions he might be able to apply to in the future, but can’t attend the events aimed at second-years. Johnny is just looking for some casual information, and can’t be bothered to do lots of research himself. One of his friends on his course tells him about the Study Abroad app, which he downloads from the iOS App Store. Johnny creates an account, and can’t fill in any details about grades but enters his department. He is then presented with a list of universities the Maths department offers, and information about the lifestyles in those cities. He is really interested in some of them, and decides he might want to apply when he is in second year. Johnny doesn’t need any of the information about visas or applying through the app, but selects some of his favourite unis so he remembers for next year. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Eddie Dixon's story</h2>
								<p style="font-weight: 100">Eddie is a second-year international student that has been interested in the Study Abroad program since the start of term, and has discussed his options with his External Tutor already. He is almost ready to apply, however he still needs some information about his visa requirements, tuition fees and living costs that his tutor can’t help him with. His tutor recommends he consults the Study Abroad app - Eddie had already made an account, so logs in to check his favourited institutions and the FAQs about visas etc. Eddie is ready to apply, but is confused by the portico process, so chooses to upload his application and send it off via the app.

								<h2 class="major">Amy Wilson's story</h2>
								<p style="font-weight: 100">Amy went to the Study Abroad information session in the History department, and is interested in pursuing the program. She has brilliant grades and is not restricted in where she can apply to, but as she works so hard, she does not have time to research all of the universities that her department offers. The Study Abroad team can’t advise her on which are the best universities to take good History classes, so they suggest she downloads the Study Abroad app to get information that is tailored to her course. Amy creates an account, and enters all the details about her course, the modules she has taken and her grades. She then looks through all of the institutions and compares their living costs, classes, distance from home, and lifestyles. She also looks at where other people from her course have applied to, to get a good idea of where History students are best placed. She also uses the app to get the contact information for her external tutor, so that she can discuss her choices before she applies.  </p>
